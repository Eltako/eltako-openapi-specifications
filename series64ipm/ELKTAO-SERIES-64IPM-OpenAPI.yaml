  version: 1.1.0
  description: |-
    ## Introduction

    The ELTAKO SERIES 62-IP, 62-IPM & 64-IPM combine the latest switching and control technology with innovative connectivity and functionality.
    This documentation covers the SERIES 62-IP, 62-IPM & 64-IPM REST API, demonstrating how these products can be used/configured via HTTP requests.
    For readability, this document will use "SERIES 64-IPM" to refer to all these devices.

    All responses are in [JSON](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/) format.

    ## Supported devices
    - ESB62NP-IP/110-240V
    - ESR62NP-IP/110-240V

    ## Getting started

    ### Test environment
    #### Postman
    Postman supports OpenAPI 3.1 documents.
    To use it:
    1. Import this OpenAPI documentation into [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
        A guide can be found [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-data-into-postman).
    2. Use the import option "OpenAPI 3.1 with a Postman Collection".
        Enable "Always inherit authentication" in the import settings.
    3. Go to the imported collection named "SERIES 62-IP, 62-IPM & 64-IPM API Doc" and follow the `/login` endpoint instructions to get the API key.
    4. Click on the Authorization tab of the collection, select the `API key` type, set the Key to `Authorization` and the Value to the apiKey from the `/login` endpoint.
    5. All other endpoints are now authorized for use.

    #### Alternative Tooling
    Direct calls using tools like [curl](https://curl.se/) are also possible.

    ### Parameters

    This documentation mentions parameters required for executing and manipulating HTTP Requests.
    These parameters must be set by the user to get a valid response and are defined in the `parameters` section of this document.

    ### Authorization

    Most endpoints require authentication.
    Users must log in to the SERIES 64-IPM with their username and password to obtain an api-key (see the `login` endpoint).
    This api-key can then be used to authenticate the user.

    ### API version

    This API uses the [Semantic Version scheme](https://semver.org/) for versioning.
    The major version is indicated within the URI of versioned requests.

    ### List of abbreviations
    - HAP - [Homekit Accessory Protocol](https://developer.apple.com/apple-home/)

    ### Errors

    Errors are structured as specified in [RFC 7807](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807).

        Get a list of all available devices.

        A device is controlled by its characteristics. Each characteristic consists of an `identifier`, the current `value` and a corresponding `type`.

        Further information about how to request possible values (ranges), enum cases and more can be found in the `/products` endpoint description.

        ## Devices
        A device in the context of an SERIES 64-IPM is defined as a generic container of atomic characteristics tied to a product.
        It does not necessarily have to be attached to a physical device.
        Attachement to a physical device is always realized through the linkage to a service device.
        For more information about service devices please refer to the API: Services section.

        A device can be used to drive the automation system of the SERIES 64-IPM device.
        For more information please refer to the API: ELTAKO Basic Automation section.
        At the root level a device consists of three elements:
        - `deviceGuid` is used to globally identify the device.
        - `productGuid` describes the structure of a device along with the required characteristics. For more information please refer to the `/products` endpoint.
        - `displayName` MAY be used to identify the device with a human-readable string.

        Multiple automations or service devices MAY be related to a single device entity.
        In addition to these elements, a device consists of characteristics that are divided into the categories `Infos`, `Settings` and `Functions`.

        ### Characteristics
        A characteristic describes an atomic partial functionality of a device. Characteristics can be of type number (Integers or floating point numbers (signed and unsigned)) or enumeration.
        Booleans are represented as enumerations to ensure extensibility.
        Other characteristic types MAY be included in future versions of this API.
        In addition, each characteristic contains an identifier and a value field.
        The identifier field can be used in combination with the product database (please refer to the API: Products section of this documentation to obtain meta information such as valid ranges, unit description, default values or enumeration values).
        The value property contains the characteristic type specific value of the characteristic.
        It can be of type string for enumeration typed characteristics or number for number typed characteristics.

        #### Functions
        Function characteristics represent the core functionality of the device. They MAY be read only.

        #### Infos
        Info characteristics provide non editable information about a device that do not represent the core functionality of the device, but instead additional information such as meta data.

        #### Settings
        Some devices can be configured.
        Setting characteristics configure the behavior of a device.
        They MUST always be editable.

      summary: Create API key for authorization
      description: |-
        For security reasons, most endpoints require an API key for authorization.

        **Such keys are reusable, and can not be deleted by the user (without resetting the device completely), so they should be treated as passwords!
        Currently the device only supports up to 10 API keys.
        If an 11th API key is requested, the first one is revoked and deleted!**

        To create an API key the proof of possession (PoP) is required, which can be found on the ELTAKO code of the device.
        For identification, a username must also be submitted, but currently the only valid user is `admin`.

        After a successful login, it returns the `apiKey` a Json web token [RFC7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) that MUST be added to the Authentication Header of each request to authenticate the requesting user (`Authorization` as the key and the `apiKey` as the value).

      summary: Get meta information for devices (product database)
      description: |-
        Get structured meta data of all products that are supported on the SERIES 64-IPM.

        The retrieved data as well as the schema of the open source product database are versioned using the [Semantic Versioning scheme](https://semver.org/).

        ### Products DB

        The product database contains smart home products along with meta-data used to describe a product in conjunction with the SERIES 64-IPM REST API.
        This section includes all necessary information from the product database required to work with the SERIES 64-IPM device.
        Therefore it contains all necessary meta data around the devices, e.g. what the valid ranges of a characteristic are and what characteristics a certain product consist of.

        #### FeatureObject Schema

        Features are the grouped functions of a product.
        They are defined by a unique, readable name that describes a specific combination of characteristics providing a specific functionality of the product.

        #### CharacteristicObject Schema

        Characteristics are atomic data values that provide functionality in conjunction with other characteristics of a feature.
        They can be categorized into three groups.

        **Infos** are characteristics holding non editable meta-data.

        **Settings** are characteristics that can configure a specific product.

        **Functions** are characteristics that contain the core functionality of a product.

        Dependent on the type of a characteristic the characteristicObject can contain additional fields.

        Each enum object is always specified by their string representation (key) and the corresponding numeric value (index).
        Clients MUST provide the string representation (key) of a characteristic within a REST API request.

        Get a list with all automations.

        ELTAKO Basic Automations are used to add functionality to the devices managed by the SERIES 62-IP(M)- & 64-IPM devices.
        Events of a sensor device such as a press of a button or the modification of a characteristic (e.g. motion detected) can trigger an automation resulting in an action for an actuator device.

        The request will return an array of automations.
        Since ESR62- & ESR64 device automations and ESB62- & ESB64 device automations differ from EUD62- & EUD64 device automations, the automations details below are listed separate.

        ## ESR62IP-, ESR64IPM- & ESB62IP & ESB64-IPM Automations
        ### Logic
        The logic of an automation is a human-readable designator for a behavior between an input device and an output device.
        For this purpose different logics have been introduced.
        - **impulse switch**: On an impulse (f.e. the press of a button) of the input device, an action directed at the output device is triggered.
        - **switch**: On an impulse or the release (f.e. the press or release of a button) of the input device, an action directed at the output device is triggered.
        - **normally opened**: This logic assumes the output actuator is normally opened (inactive).
          The impulse of the input device leads to closing the output of the actuator, while the release of the input device leads to the reopening of the output of the actuator.
        - **normally closed**: This logic assumes the output actuator is normally closed (active).
          The impulse of the input device leads to opening the output of the actuator, while the release of the input device leads to the reclosing of the output of the actuator.
        - **target**: On an impulse (f.e. the press of a button) of the input device, the output device is requested to assume the target value of the automations addOn.
          If the target value is omitted from the automation, the target toggles between the maximum and minimum value after each impulse of the input device.

        Please refer to the Workflows section for detailed use cases for the different SERIES 64-IPM device as not all device support all logics and some logics require different addOns for different devices.

        ### AddOns
        AddOns provide additional information to extend the behavior of automations by different parameters.
        These could instantiate timers, perform some exemptions or simply provide additional data.
        For this purpose, the following addOns have been introduced:

        | Addon | Supported Devices | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | `targetValue` | ESB62NP-IP, ESB64NP-IPM, ESR62-IP, ESR64-IPM | The targetValue addOn is used with target logic to provide a desired target value for automation. |
        | `offTimer` | ESR62-IP, ESR64-IPM | A short button press turns off the device after the given time |
        | `longPressOffTimer` | ESR62-IP, ESR64-IPM | A long button press turns off the device after the given time |
        | `prewarning` | ESR62-IP, ESR64-IPM | Let the relay flicker 3 times at increasingly shorter intervals 30 seconds before turning off, this addon is to be combined with the offtimer addon or the longPressOffTimer addon |
        | `shortPressNormallyOpened` | ESB62NP-IP, ESB64NP-IPM | The shortPressNormallyOpened addOn is used with targetValue addOn to control the ESB in GS4 mode |
        | `extraLongPressNormallyOpened` | ESB64NP-IPM | The extraLongPressNormallyOpened addOn is used to tell the ESB if the last tilt angle shall be stored as new automaticSlat angle |
        | `automaticReversal` | ESB64NP-IPM | The automaticReversal addOn is used in ESB to tilt the blind back to this angle, when the lower end position is reached |
        | `automaticSlat` | ESB64NP-IPM | The automaticSlat addOn is used in ESB to tilt the blind back to this angle, when the motion of the blind is stopped |

        Not all devices support automations with all AddOns.

        ## EUD62IP(M)- & EUD64-IPM Automations
        ### EUD Automation Logic
        The logic for EUD62IP(M)- & EUD64-IPM automations is slightly different from the device automations above.
        The automation core builds the automation logic.
        Each automation logic supports different logicConfigurations to unify the behavior of the device.
        Some logics support additional extensions to the logic itself, which also can be configured in the logicConfiguration.
        Overview of the different logics and their possible configurations below.

        | Logic | Description | Required LogicConfiguration | [Supported Extensions](#logicconfiguration-extensions) |

        | [`directionalDownButtonDimmer`](#directionaldownbuttondimmer) | The directionalDownButtonDimmer logic is used to turn off and dim down the EUD device. | `turnOffDuration`, `dimDuration` | `slumberExtension` |
        | [`centralUpButtonDimmer`](#centralupbuttondimmer) | The centralUpButtonDimmer logic is used to turn on the EUD device to `maximumBrightness`. | `turnOnDuration` | |
        | [`centralDownButtonDimmer`](#centraldownbuttondimmer) | The centralDownButtonDimmer logic is used to turn off the EUD device. | `turnOffDuration` | |
        | [`sceneButtonDimmer`](#scenebuttondimmer) | The sceneButtonDimmer logic is used to link the currentBrightness to a scene and dim to the scene. | `turnOnDuration`, `turnOffDuration`, `dimDuration`, `targetBrightness` | `sceneValueOverrideExtension` |

        | `slumberExtension` | The slumberExtension is used to gradually dim the EUD device to zero brightness. This can be set with a low `dimDuration` to create a soothing fade-out effect, helping to promote relaxation or sleep. | `enabled`, `dimDuration` | [`universalButtonDimmer`](#universalbuttondimmer), [`directionalDownButtonDimmer`](#directionaldownbuttondimmer) |
        | `lightAlarmExtension` | The lightAlarmExtension is used to gradually increase the brightness of the EUD device to the `maximumBrightness`. This can be set with a longer dimDuration to simulate a sunrise effect, helping to gently wake up the user. | `enabled`, `dimDuration` | [`directionalUpButtonDimmer`](#directionalupbuttondimmer) |
        | `sceneValueOverrideExtension` | The sceneValueOverrideExtension is used to override the `sceneValue` of the sceneButtonDimmer logic with the `currentBrightness` onto the scene. | `enabled` | [`sceneButtonDimmer`](#scenebuttondimmer) |
